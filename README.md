<h3>Application providing village expansion, resource gathering and mining.</h3>

<hr/>

[Application at Heroku](https://villagers-app.herokuapp.com/)


<p>For testing application locally there's available sql file village.sql.</p>
There might occur error while importing database file, because of used uuid() expression as default value of column id in player and resource table.
